# Ghostbird's personal website
Previously I self-hosted this website on my Raspberry Pi 1B. However, after 4 years of near-continous uptime, the SD-card had worn out, and the system became erratic and would not reboot. I decided to host the website on Github Pages and use the Raspberry Pi with a fresh SD-card for something else.
