      <h2>
        My interests
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have many interests, too many in fact to pursue them all, I will list the main ones here in a hopefully orderly fashion.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Computer Science
      </h3>
      <p>
        Internet of Things, GNU/Linux, FOSS software, source management, operating systems, information security, system security, hacking, communication protocols, futuristic human machine interfaces, etcetera. 
      </p>
      <h3>

      <p>
        ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, prototyping tools, sensors, controllers, domotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know little about analogue electronics, and focus on modular parts that communicate over digital protocols e.g. I²C, SPI, UART, etcetera.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Other sciences
      </h3>
      <p>
        Besides the mathematics and physics related to computer science, I have a rudimentary understanding of mechatronics, the mechanisms of flight and space travel, and particle physics.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Law
      </h3>
      <p>
        Software licenses, information law, privacy law, private aviation law e.g. related to drone flights.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Reading
      </h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy reading books such as The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis and the Discworld series by Sir T.J.D. Pratchett, Kt, OBE.
      </p>
      <p>
        I read in various formats on the web, for example; English translations of the Korean webtoon Tower of God, the online archives of comics Calvin and Hobbes and Cul-de-Sac, the web-comic Freefall, and the fan-fiction web-serial Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Games
      </h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy games with high levels of immersion and freedom. Among my favourites are: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind which I run on the OpenMW engine, Kerbal Space Program, Discworld MUD, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, Myst and Riven.
